## Lowest common multiple
Finding the lowest common multiple of two numbers is very simple. Firstly, one way to find teh LCM of two numbers is to start by listing the prime numbers for each of the two numbers. So for example if we have take 60 and 70, the prime numbrs of 60 are 2, 2, 3, 5 and the prime numbers of 70 are 2, 5 and 7. Then we have to multiply each factor the greatest number of times it appears in both numbers. If the same number occurs more than once in both numbers, you have to multiply the factor the greatest number of times it occurs. So we have 60 = 2 x 2 x 3 x 5 and 70 = 2 x 5 x 7; 2 occurs twice, 3 occurs once, 5 occurs once and 7 occurs once. We then have to multiple them; 2 x 2 x 3 x 5 x 7 = 420. So 420 is the LCM of 60 and 70.
